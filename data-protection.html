        <h2 class="display-5 text-muted">We think it’s important that you read this page, it provides information on the Ediflo services affected by the upcoming General Data Protection Regulation.</h2>
		</div>

		<div id="product" class="container p-t-5">
			<h2 class="display-4 text-muted">What is the GDPR?</h2>
      <p>
      GDPR is the General Data Protection Regulation. It comes into effect from 25 May 2018. It sets out a series of new EU laws concerning how data is processed and used. The objective of the regulation is to strengthen and standardize data protection laws for all EU citizens. These regulations will apply to any organisation that controls and/or processes data on behalf of an individual or group of individuals. Those responsible for adhering to these regulations include employees of the organisation, including contractors, consultants, agents and third parties who have access to data either directly or indirectly.</p>
		</div>
    <div id="product" class="container p-t-5">
			<h2 class="display-4 text-muted">What does this mean for Ediflo Customers?</h2>
      <p>
  The GDPR imposes obligations on data controllers and data processors. Ediflo customers act as the "data controller" for any personal data about their end-users they provide to Ediflo in connection with their use of the platform, and Ediflo is, generally, a "data processor".</p>
    </div>
		</div>
    <div id="product" class="container p-t-5">
      <h2 class="display-4 text-muted">Who we are?</h2>
      <p>Axonista, owns, updates & operators the product platform Ediflo.
      Ediflo in this context is refers to following features which may be involved with the processing of personal data for your organisation:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Ediflo the Video Content Management System.</li>
          <li>Remoco API.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="product" class="container p-t-5">
      <h2 class="display-4 text-muted">What does this mean for our customers?</h2>
      <p>The data we process is under the customer's control. Controllers are responsible for obligations like fulfilling an individual's rights with respect to their personal data.</p>
      <p>If you're a customer, and would like to understand your responsibilities as a data controller, you should familiarize yourself with the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679" target="_blank">provisions of the GDPR</a>, and check on your compliance plans.</p>
      <p>Key questions to consider:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>How does your organization ensure user transparency and control around data use?</li>
          <li>Are you sure that your organization has the right consents in place where these are needed under the GDPR?</li>
          <li>Does your organization have the right systems to record user preferences and consents?</li>
          <li>How will you show regulators and partners that you meet the principles of the GDPR and are an accountable organisation?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="product" class="container p-t-5">
      <h2 class="display-4 text-muted">Does my organisation need to make changes to our applications which send personal data to Ediflo?</h2>
      <p>Potentially, if you don’t have a Lawful basis to send us personal data, you will need to get it. A common method is requesting consent from your data subjects, but there are other less intrusive methods too.</p>
      <p>In a processor role, Axonista assumes that the personal data that is sent to Ediflo has all the proper lawful bases for its use. This means that any applications can be used to send personal data to Ediflo as long as you have gained the proper Lawful basis to do so, whether via consent from the user, or another basis.</p>
      <p>For applications that are managed by Axonista, please contact us at <a href="mailto:dpo@axonista.com" target="_top">dpo@axonista.com</a> to discuss methods of acquiring a Lawful basis to send Ediflo personal data.</p>
